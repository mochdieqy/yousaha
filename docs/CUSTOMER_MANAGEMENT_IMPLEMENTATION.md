# Customer Management Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of the Customer Management system for the Yousaha ERP application, following the sequence diagrams and requirements specified in the master data documentation.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Customer Controller (`app/Http/Controllers/CustomerController.php`)
- **Index Method**: Lists all customers with search and filtering capabilities
- **Create Method**: Shows form for creating new customers
- **Store Method**: Saves new customer data with validation
- **Edit Method**: Shows form for editing existing customers
- **Update Method**: Updates customer data with validation
- **Destroy Method**: Deletes customers with transaction safety checks

### 2. Customer Views
- **Index View** (`resources/views/pages/customer/index.blade.php`): Customer listing with search, filters, and actions
- **Create View** (`resources/views/pages/customer/create.blade.php`): Form for adding new customers
- **Edit View** (`resources/views/pages/customer/edit.blade.php`): Form for editing existing customers

### 3. Customer Model (`app/Models/Customer.php`)
- Supports both individual and company customer types
- Company isolation through `company_id` foreign key
- Relationships with SalesOrder model
- Helper methods for customer type checking

### 4. Routes
- All CRUD operations properly routed with permission middleware
- RESTful routing following Laravel conventions
- Permission-based access control

### 5. Data Seeding
- **CustomerSeeder** (`database/seeders/CustomerSeeder.php`): Populates sample customer data
- 8 individual customers and 8 company customers
- Integrated with main DatabaseSeeder
