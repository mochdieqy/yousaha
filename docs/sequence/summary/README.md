## ðŸ”„ Simplified Architecture Overview

### System Components
- **Frontend**: User interface (Bootstrap-based views)
- **Backend**: Laravel controllers and business logic
- **Database**: MySQL database with transactions
- **Auth**: Authentication and company access control
- **Validator**: Input validation and business rules
- **Services**: External service integrations (AI, PDF, etc.)

### Common Flow Pattern
All modules follow a consistent pattern:
1. **Access Control**: Company-based authentication
2. **Data Retrieval**: Query database with relationships
3. **User Action**: Perform CRUD or workflow operations
4. **Validation**: Input validation and business rules
5. **Transaction**: Database operations with rollback
6. **Response**: Success/error feedback to user

### Key Business Rules
- **Company Isolation**: Multi-tenant data separation
- **Transaction Safety**: Database transactions with rollback
- **Validation**: Comprehensive input validation
- **Dependency Checks**: Prevents deletion of referenced data
- **Status Workflows**: Status-based progression control
- **Financial Integration**: Automatic GL entries for transactions
