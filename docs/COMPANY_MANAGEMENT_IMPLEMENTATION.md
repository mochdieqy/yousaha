# Company Management Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the company management flow after user login in the Yousaha ERP system, as specified in the sequence diagrams in `docs/sequence/company-management.md`.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Modified HomeController

The `HomeController` has been updated to implement the company management flow:

- **`Home()` method**: Now checks if the authenticated user is associated with a company
  - If user owns a company → shows home page
  - If user is an employee → shows home page
  - If user is not in any company → redirects to company choice page

- **`companyChoice()` method**: Displays the role selection page
- **`createCompany()` method**: Shows the company creation form
- **`storeCompany()` method**: Handles company creation and saves to database
- **`employeeInvitation()` method**: Shows the employee invitation information page

### 2. New Routes

Added the following routes in `routes/web.php`:

```php
Route::middleware(['auth'])->group(function () {
    // Company management routes
    Route::get('company/choice', [HomeController::class, 'companyChoice'])->name('company.choice');
    Route::get('company/create', [HomeController::class, 'createCompany'])->name('company.create');
    Route::post('company/store', [HomeController::class, 'storeCompany'])->name('company.store');
    Route::get('company/employee-invitation', [HomeController::class, 'employeeInvitation'])->name('company.employee-invitation');
});
```

### 3. New Views

#### Company Choice Page (`resources/views/pages/company/choice.blade.php`)

- **Features**:
  - Two interactive cards for role selection
  - Business Owner → redirects to company creation
  - Employee → redirects to invitation information
  - Information about what happens next
  - Sign out option

#### Company Creation Form (`resources/views/pages/company/create.blade.php`)
- **Purpose**: Form for business owners to create their company
- **Fields**:
  - Company Name (required)
  - Company Address (required)
  - Phone Number (required)
  - Website (optional)
- **Features**:
  - Form validation with error display
  - Success message handling
  - Back to choice navigation
  - Information about system benefits

#### Employee Invitation Page (`resources/views/pages/company/employee-invitation.blade.php`)

- **Features**:

  - User's email address display
  - Step-by-step instructions
  - FAQ section
  - Support contact information
  - Navigation back to choice or sign out

### 4. Enhanced Home Page

The home page (`resources/views/pages/home/index.blade.php`) now includes:

- **Company Information Header**: Shows company details when user is in a company
- **Role Badge**: Displays whether user is Company Owner or Employee
- **Success Messages**: Shows confirmation when company is created

### 5. Styling and CSS

Added custom CSS in `resources/css/app.css`:

- Custom button and form styling
- Responsive design elements
- Shadow and opacity utilities

## Flow Implementation

### Post-Login Flow

1. **User logs in** → `AuthController@SignInProcess`
2. **Redirected to home** → `HomeController@Home`
3. **Company check**:
   - **Has company** → Show home page with company info
   - **No company** → Redirect to company choice page

### Company Choice Flow

1. **Company Choice Page** → User selects role
2. **Business Owner** → Company creation form
3. **Employee** → Invitation information page

### Business Owner Flow

1. **Create Company Form** → User fills company details
2. **Form Submission** → `storeCompany()` method
3. **Database Save** → Company created with user as owner
4. **Redirect** → Home page with company information

### Employee Flow

1. **Invitation Page** → User sees invitation instructions
2. **Contact Manager** → User contacts their boss
3. **Wait for Invitation** → Manager invites user via system
4. **Access Granted** → User can access company ERP

## Database Integration

- **Company Model**: Uses existing `companies` table
- **User Relationship**: `User` has many `Company` (as owner)
- **Employee Relationship**: `User` has one `Employee` record
- **Validation**: Form validation ensures data integrity

## Security Features

- **Authentication Required**: All company routes use `auth` middleware
- **Data Isolation**: Multi-tenant system ensures company data separation
- **Owner Assignment**: Only authenticated user can create company
- **Form Validation**: Server-side validation prevents invalid data

## User Experience Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects and smooth transitions
- **Clear Navigation**: Easy to move between pages
- **Informative Content**: Helpful instructions and FAQs
- **Visual Feedback**: Success messages and error handling

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. **Login as new user** → Should redirect to company choice
2. **Select Business Owner** → Should show company creation form
3. **Create company** → Should redirect to home with company info
4. **Select Employee** → Should show invitation information
5. **Login as company owner** → Should show home with company info

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the company management system:

1. **Email Invitations**: Automated email system for employee invitations
2. **Company Settings**: Allow company owners to modify company details
3. **User Management**: Company owners can manage employee access
4. **Company Switching**: Support for users in multiple companies
5. **Audit Logging**: Track company creation and modification activities

## Conclusion

The company management flow has been successfully implemented according to the sequence diagrams. The system now properly handles:

- Post-login company verification
- Role-based user experience
- Company creation for business owners
- Employee invitation process
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- Enhanced user interface and experience

All components are properly integrated with the existing Laravel application structure and follow the established coding patterns and conventions.
