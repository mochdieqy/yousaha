# Receipt Management Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of receipt management functionality in the Yousaha ERP system, based on the inventory management sequence diagrams.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Receipt CRUD Operations
- **Create Receipt**: Create new receipts with supplier, scheduled date, reference, and products
- **View Receipt**: Display receipt details with status management
- **Edit Receipt**: Edit receipts in draft or waiting status
- **Delete Receipt**: Delete receipts only in draft status

### 2. Status Management
- **Status Flow**: draft → waiting → ready → done
- **Status Cancellation**: Can cancel at any stage
- **Status History**: Track all status changes with timestamps

### 3. Goods Receiving Process
- **Stock Updates**: Automatically update stock quantities when goods are received
- **Stock Details**: Create detailed stock records for tracking
- **Stock History**: Maintain audit trail of stock changes

### 4. Product Management
- **Dynamic Product Lines**: Add/remove products dynamically in forms
- **Quantity Validation**: Ensure positive quantities
- **Product Selection**: Choose from company's product catalog

## Technical Implementation

### Controller
- **ReceiptController**: Handles all receipt operations
- **Transaction Management**: Uses database transactions for data integrity
- **Permission Checks**: Implements role-based access control
- **Validation**: Comprehensive input validation

### Models
- **Receipt**: Main receipt entity with supplier and scheduling
- **ReceiptProductLine**: Product line items with quantities
- **ReceiptStatusLog**: Status change history
- **Stock**: Stock management integration
- **StockDetail**: Detailed stock tracking
- **StockHistory**: Stock change audit trail

### Views
- **Index**: List all receipts with status and actions
- **Create**: Dynamic form for creating new receipts
- **Edit**: Pre-filled form for editing receipts
- **Show**: Detailed view with status management

### Routes
```php
// Receipt Management Routes
Route::middleware(['permission:receipts.view'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('receipts', [ReceiptController::class, 'index'])->name('receipts.index');
    Route::get('receipts/{receipt}', [ReceiptController::class, 'show'])->name('receipts.show');
});

Route::middleware(['permission:receipts.create'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('receipts/create', [ReceiptController::class, 'create'])->name('receipts.create');
    Route::post('receipts', [ReceiptController::class, 'store'])->name('receipts.store');
});

Route::middleware(['permission:receipts.edit'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('receipts/{receipt}/edit', [ReceiptController::class, 'edit'])->name('receipts.edit');
    Route::put('receipts/{receipt}', [ReceiptController::class, 'update'])->name('receipts.update');
    Route::post('receipts/{receipt}/status', [ReceiptController::class, 'updateStatus'])->name('receipts.update-status');
    Route::post('receipts/{receipt}/goods-receive', [ReceiptController::class, 'goodsReceive'])->name('receipts.goods-receive');
});

Route::middleware(['permission:receipts.delete'])->group(function () {
    Route::delete('receipts/{receipt}', [ReceiptController::class, 'destroy'])->name('receipts.delete');
});
```

## Business Logic

### Status Transitions
1. **Draft**: Initial state, can be edited and deleted
2. **Waiting**: Confirmed receipt, limited editing
3. **Ready**: Ready for goods receiving
4. **Done**: Goods received, stock updated
5. **Cancel**: Cancelled at any stage

### Stock Integration
- **Automatic Updates**: Stock quantities updated during status changes
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of stock changes
- **Multi-warehouse Support**: Ready for future warehouse-specific implementation

### Validation Rules
- **Supplier**: Must exist and belong to company
- **Products**: At least one product required
- **Quantities**: Must be positive numbers
- **Dates**: Scheduled date is required
- **Status**: Only valid status transitions allowed

## User Interface Features

### Home Page Integration
- **Active Links**: Receipt management accessible from home page
- **Permission-based Display**: Only show for users with receipt permissions
- **Quick Access**: Direct links to receipt operations

### Form Features
- **Dynamic Product Rows**: Add/remove products dynamically
- **Real-time Validation**: Client-side validation for better UX
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface
- **Status Indicators**: Clear visual status representation

### Data Tables
- **Sorting**: Sort by various columns
- **Search**: Search across receipt data
- **Pagination**: Handle large numbers of receipts
- **Action Buttons**: Context-sensitive actions based on status

## Security Features

### Permission System
- **View**: Basic receipt viewing
- **Create**: Create new receipts
- **Edit**: Modify existing receipts
- **Delete**: Remove receipts

### Data Isolation
- **Company Scoping**: Users only see company receipts
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive server-side validation

- **Advanced Search**: Full-text search and filtering

## Testing

### Manual Testing
