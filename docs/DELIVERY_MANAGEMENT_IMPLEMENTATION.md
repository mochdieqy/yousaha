# Delivery Management Implementation

## Overview

The Delivery Management system has been implemented based on the sequence diagrams from the inventory management documentation. This system handles the complete lifecycle of goods issue (delivery) operations, from creation to completion.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Core Delivery Management
- **Create Delivery**: Create new delivery orders with multiple product lines
- **Edit Delivery**: Modify existing deliveries (only in draft/waiting status)
- **View Delivery**: Display delivery details, product lines, and status history
- **Delete Delivery**: Remove deliveries (only in draft status)
- **Status Management**: Update delivery status through workflow

### 2. Status Workflow
The delivery follows a defined status progression:
- **Draft** → **Waiting** → **Ready** → **Done**
- **Cancel** status available at any point
- Status changes are logged with timestamps

### 3. Goods Issue Processing
- **Stock Validation**: Ensures sufficient stock before processing
- **Stock Updates**: Automatically reduces stock quantities
- **FIFO Processing**: Stock details are processed in First-In-First-Out order
- **Stock History**: Tracks all stock movements

### 4. Product Line Management
- Dynamic addition/removal of product lines
- Quantity validation
- Price calculations
- SKU and product information display

## Database Structure

### Tables
1. **deliveries** - Main delivery records
2. **delivery_product_lines** - Product line items
3. **delivery_status_logs** - Status change history

### Key Fields
- `company_id` - Multi-company support
- `warehouse_id` - Source warehouse
- `delivery_address` - Destination address
- `scheduled_at` - Delivery schedule
- `status` - Current status
- `reference` - Optional reference number

## API Endpoints

### Delivery Management
- `GET /deliveries` - List all deliveries
- `GET /deliveries/create` - Create form
- `POST /deliveries` - Store new delivery
- `GET /deliveries/{id}` - View delivery details
- `GET /deliveries/{id}/edit` - Edit form
- `PUT /deliveries/{id}` - Update delivery
- `DELETE /deliveries/{id}` - Delete delivery

### Status Management
- `POST /deliveries/{id}/status` - Update status
- `POST /deliveries/{id}/goods-issue` - Process goods issue

## User Interface

### Views
1. **Index View** (`/deliveries`)
   - Delivery list with status badges
   - Action buttons based on status
   - Pagination support
   - Search and filtering (planned)

2. **Create View** (`/deliveries/create`)
   - Dynamic product line management
   - Form validation
   - Warehouse and product selection

3. **Edit View** (`/deliveries/{id}/edit`)
   - Pre-filled form data
   - Status update options
   - Product line modifications

4. **Show View** (`/deliveries/{id}`)
   - Complete delivery information
   - Status timeline
   - Action buttons for status management

### Features
- **Bootstrap Modals**: Used for confirmations and goods issue processing
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface
- **Status Badges**: Visual status indicators
- **Timeline Display**: Status change history
- **Permission-Based Access**: Role-based functionality

## Business Logic

### Status Transitions
- **Draft → Waiting**: Initial approval
- **Waiting → Ready**: Stock validation and preparation
- **Ready → Done**: Goods issue processing
- **Any → Cancel**: Cancellation at any stage

### Stock Management
- **Pre-validation**: Check stock availability when status changes to 'ready'
- **Stock Reduction**: FIFO-based stock deduction during goods issue
- **History Tracking**: Complete audit trail of stock movements

### Validation Rules
- Only draft/waiting deliveries can be edited
- Only ready deliveries can be processed for goods issue
- Only draft deliveries can be deleted
- Scheduled date must be in the future

## Security & Permissions

### Permission System
- `deliveries.view` - View delivery list and details
- `deliveries.create` - Create new deliveries
- `deliveries.edit` - Edit existing deliveries
- `deliveries.delete` - Delete deliveries

### Data Isolation
- Company-based data separation
- User can only access deliveries from their current company
- Warehouse and product validation against company context

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- **Feature Tests**: Complete workflow testing
- **Status Management**: Status transition validation
- **Goods Issue**: Stock update verification
- **Permission Tests**: Access control validation
- **Validation Tests**: Form and business rule validation

### Test Data
- **Factories**: Delivery, DeliveryProductLine, DeliveryStatusLog
- **Seeders**: Sample delivery data for development
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflow testing

## Integration Points

### Stock Management
- Automatic stock updates during goods issue
- Stock history tracking
- Stock detail management (FIFO)

### Warehouse Management
- Warehouse selection for deliveries
- Company-warehouse relationship validation

### Product Management
- Product selection and validation
- SKU and pricing information
- Company-product relationship

## Future Enhancements

3. **Email Notifications**: Status change notifications
4. **Reporting**: Delivery analytics and reports
5. **Mobile App**: Native mobile application
6. **API Integration**: External system integration

### Performance Optimizations
