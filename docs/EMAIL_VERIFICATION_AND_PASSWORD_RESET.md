# Email Verification and Password Reset Implementation

This document describes the implementation of email verification and password reset functionality in the Yousaha ERP system.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Email Verification System
- **Automatic verification email** sent upon user registration
- **Verification link** with 24-hour expiration
- **Resend verification** functionality for users who didn't receive the email
- **Login restriction** until email is verified

### 2. Password Reset System
- **Forgot password** page for users who can't remember their password
- **Password reset link** sent via email with 24-hour expiration
- **Secure password reset** with current password verification
- **Password confirmation** validation

### 3. Profile Management
- **Profile editing** for user information (name, phone, birthday, gender, etc.)
- **Password change** functionality with current password verification
- **Email protection** - users cannot change their email address for security reasons

## Implementation Details

### Database Tables
- `users` - Contains `verify_at` timestamp for email verification status
- `email_verifications` - Stores verification tokens and expiration
- `password_reset_tokens` - Stores password reset tokens and expiration

### Routes Added

#### Public Routes (No Authentication Required)
```php
// Email verification
Route::get('verify-email/{token}', [AuthController::class, 'verifyEmail'])->name('auth.verify-email');
Route::get('resend-verification', [AuthController::class, 'showResendVerification'])->name('auth.resend-verification');
Route::post('resend-verification', [AuthController::class, 'resendVerification'])->name('auth.resend-verification-process');

// Password reset
Route::get('forgot-password', [AuthController::class, 'showForgotPassword'])->name('auth.forgot-password');
Route::post('forgot-password', [AuthController::class, 'forgotPassword'])->name('auth.forgot-password-process');
Route::get('reset-password/{token}', [AuthController::class, 'showResetPassword'])->name('auth.reset-password');
Route::post('reset-password/{token}', [AuthController::class, 'resetPassword'])->name('auth.reset-password-process');
```

#### Protected Routes (Authentication Required)
```php
// Profile management
Route::get('profile', [AuthController::class, 'showProfile'])->name('auth.profile');
Route::post('profile/update', [AuthController::class, 'updateProfile'])->name('auth.profile-update');
Route::post('profile/password', [AuthController::class, 'updatePassword'])->name('auth.password-update');
```

### Controllers

#### AuthController Methods Added
- `verifyEmail($token)` - Verifies user email with token
- `showResendVerification()` - Shows resend verification page
- `resendVerification(Request $request)` - Resends verification email
- `showForgotPassword()` - Shows forgot password page
- `forgotPassword(Request $request)` - Processes forgot password request
- `showResetPassword($token)` - Shows password reset form
- `resetPassword(Request $request, $token)` - Processes password reset
- `showProfile()` - Shows user profile page
- `updateProfile(Request $request)` - Updates user profile
- `updatePassword(Request $request)` - Updates user password

### Views Created

#### Authentication Pages
- `resources/views/pages/auth/forgot-password.blade.php` - Forgot password form
- `resources/views/pages/auth/reset-password.blade.php` - Password reset form
- `resources/views/pages/auth/resend-verification.blade.php` - Resend verification form
- `resources/views/pages/auth/profile.blade.php` - User profile management

#### Email Templates
- `resources/views/emails/verify-email.blade.php` - Email verification template
- `resources/views/emails/reset-password.blade.php` - Password reset template

### Models

#### EmailVerification Model
- Handles email verification tokens
- Includes expiration checking methods
- Automatic token generation

#### PasswordResetToken Model
- Handles password reset tokens
- Includes expiration checking methods
- Automatic token generation

## User Workflow

### 1. Registration and Email Verification
1. User registers with email and password
2. System sends verification email automatically
3. User clicks verification link in email
4. Email is marked as verified
5. User can now login

### 2. Password Reset
1. User clicks "Forgot Password" on login page
2. User enters email address
3. System sends password reset email
4. User clicks reset link in email
5. User enters new password
6. Password is updated and user can login

### 3. Profile Management
1. User clicks profile dropdown in navbar
2. User selects "Profile Settings"
3. User can edit personal information
4. User can change password (with current password verification)
5. Changes are saved immediately

## Security Features

### Email Verification
- **24-hour expiration** for verification links
- **One-time use** tokens (deleted after verification)
- **Secure token generation** using random bytes

### Password Reset
- **24-hour expiration** for reset links
- **One-time use** tokens (deleted after password change)
- **Current password verification** required for password changes
- **Password confirmation** validation

### Profile Protection
- **Email address cannot be changed** for security reasons
- **Current password required** for password changes
- **Input validation** and sanitization
- **CSRF protection** on all forms

## Email Configuration

The system uses Laravel's built-in mail system. Ensure your `.env` file contains:

```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=your-smtp-host
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your-smtp-username
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-smtp-password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="noreply@yourdomain.com"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Yousaha ERP"
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Registration**: Create a new account and verify email verification
2. **Login**: Try to login before email verification (should fail)
3. **Email Verification**: Click verification link and verify login works
4. **Forgot Password**: Test password reset functionality
5. **Profile Management**: Test profile editing and password changes

### Email Testing
- Use services like Mailtrap for development
- Check email templates render correctly
- Verify links work and tokens expire properly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Emails not sending**: Check SMTP configuration in `.env`
2. **Verification links not working**: Check token expiration and database
3. **Password reset failing**: Verify token validity and user existence
4. **Profile updates failing**: Check validation rules and database fields

### Debug Steps
1. Check Laravel logs in `storage/logs/laravel.log`
2. Verify database tables exist and have correct structure
3. Test email configuration with `php artisan tinker`
4. Check route list with `php artisan route:list`

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Email queue system** for better performance
2. **Two-factor authentication** (2FA)
3. **Account lockout** after failed attempts
4. **Password strength requirements**
5. **Email change verification** process
6. **Account deletion** with email confirmation

### Security Enhancements
1. **Rate limiting** for password reset requests
2. **Audit logging** for security events
3. **IP-based restrictions** for sensitive operations
4. **Session management** improvements

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a comprehensive authentication and user management system with:
- Secure email verification
- Robust password reset functionality
- User-friendly profile management
- Strong security measures
- Professional email templates

The system follows Laravel best practices and provides a solid foundation for user authentication and management in the Yousaha ERP application.
