- **Index**: `resources/views/pages/supplier/index.blade.php`
  - Supplier list with search and filtering
  - Pagination support
  - Action buttons (edit/delete)
  - Delete confirmation modal
  
- **Create**: `resources/views/pages/supplier/create.blade.php`
  - Form for adding new suppliers

  - Dynamic placeholder text based on type
  
- **Edit**: `resources/views/pages/supplier/edit.blade.php`
  - Form for updating existing suppliers
  - Pre-filled form data
  - Supplier details display

### Routes
```php
// Supplier Management
Route::middleware(['permission:suppliers.view'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('suppliers', [SupplierController::class, 'index'])->name('suppliers.index');
});

Route::middleware(['permission:suppliers.create'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('suppliers/create', [SupplierController::class, 'create'])->name('suppliers.create');
    Route::post('suppliers', [SupplierController::class, 'store'])->name('suppliers.store');
});

Route::middleware(['permission:suppliers.edit'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('suppliers/{supplier}/edit', [SupplierController::class, 'edit'])->name('suppliers.edit');
    Route::put('suppliers/{supplier}', [SupplierController::class, 'update'])->name('suppliers.update');
});

Route::middleware(['permission:suppliers.delete'])->group(function () {
    Route::delete('suppliers/{supplier}', [SupplierController::class, 'destroy'])->name('suppliers.delete');
});
```

### Permissions
The following permissions are required and already defined in the system:
- `suppliers.view` - View supplier list
- `suppliers.create` - Create new suppliers
- `suppliers.edit` - Edit existing suppliers
- `suppliers.delete` - Delete suppliers

### Navigation Integration
- **Sidebar**: Supplier link activated in `resources/views/layouts/home.blade.php`
- **Home Page**: Supplier Management card linked in `resources/views/pages/home/index.blade.php`

## Business Logic

### Validation Rules
- **Type**: Required, must be 'individual' or 'company'
- **Name**: Required, max 255 characters
- **Address**: Optional, max 500 characters
- **Phone**: Optional, max 20 characters
- **Email**: Optional, valid email format, max 255 characters

### Security Features
- **Company Isolation**: Suppliers are isolated per company
- **Permission Checks**: All operations require appropriate permissions
- **Data Validation**: Server-side and client-side validation
- **CSRF Protection**: All forms include CSRF tokens

### Delete Protection
Suppliers cannot be deleted if they are referenced in:
- Purchase Orders
- Receipts

## User Experience Features

### Search and Filtering
- **Search**: By name, email, or phone
- **Filter**: By supplier type (individual/company)
- **Clear Filters**: Easy reset of search criteria

### Responsive Design
- Bootstrap 5 responsive grid system
- Mobile-friendly table layout
- Consistent with existing application design

### Interactive Elements
- Delete confirmation modal
- Dynamic form placeholders
- Real-time validation feedback
- Breadcrumb navigation

## Database Integration

### Model Relationships
```php
// Supplier belongs to Company
public function company()
{
    return $this->belongsTo(Company::class);
}

// Supplier has many Purchase Orders
public function purchaseOrders()
{
    return $this->hasMany(PurchaseOrder::class);
}

// Supplier has many Receipts
public function receipts()
{
    return $this->hasMany(Receipt::class, 'receive_from');
}
```

### Migration
The suppliers table migration already exists with the following structure:
- `id` - Primary key
- `company_id` - Foreign key to companies table
- `type` - Supplier type (individual/company)
- `name` - Supplier name
- `address` - Physical address
- `phone` - Contact number
- `email` - Email address
- `created_at` - Creation timestamp
- `updated_at` - Last update timestamp

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] View supplier list (requires `suppliers.view` permission)
- [ ] Create new supplier (requires `suppliers.create` permission)
- [ ] Edit existing supplier (requires `suppliers.edit` permission)
- [ ] Delete supplier (requires `suppliers.delete` permission)
- [ ] Search and filter functionality
- [ ] Permission-based access control
- [ ] Company isolation
- [ ] Form validation
- [ ] Delete protection for referenced suppliers

### Automated Testing
- Route testing: `php artisan route:list --name=suppliers`
- Controller existence: Verified via Tinker
- View compilation: Cleared and verified

## Data Seeding

### SupplierSeeder
A comprehensive seeder has been created to populate the database with sample supplier data:

**File**: `database/seeders/SupplierSeeder.php`

**Features**:
- Creates 8 individual suppliers with realistic Indonesian names and contact information
- Creates 12 company suppliers representing various business types (PT, CV, UD)
- All suppliers are associated with the demo company
- Uses `firstOrCreate` to prevent duplicate entries

**Sample Individual Suppliers**:
- Ahmad Rizki, Sarah Wijaya, Budi Santoso, Dewi Putri
- Rudi Hermawan, Nina Sari, Agus Setiawan, Maya Indah

**Sample Company Suppliers**:
- PT Maju Bersama Teknologi, CV Sukses Mandiri
- PT Global Solutions Indonesia, UD Makmur Jaya
- PT Digital Innovation Hub, CV Kreasi Digital
- And 6 more company suppliers

**Usage**:
```bash
# Run only the supplier seeder
php artisan db:seed --class=SupplierSeeder

# Run all seeders (including supplier seeder)
php artisan db:seed
```

**Data Structure**:
- **Individual Suppliers**: Personal names, mobile phone numbers, personal emails
- **Company Suppliers**: Company names, office phone numbers, business emails
- **Addresses**: Realistic Indonesian addresses with proper formatting
- **Contact Info**: Valid phone number and email formats

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Supplier Categories**: Add supplier categorization (e.g., raw materials, services, equipment)
2. **Contact History**: Track communication history with suppliers
3. **Performance Metrics**: Supplier rating and performance tracking
4. **Document Management**: Attach documents (contracts, certificates)
5. **Bulk Operations**: Import/export suppliers, bulk updates
6. **API Integration**: REST API endpoints for external systems

### Integration Points
- **Purchase Orders**: Already integrated via model relationships
- **Receipts**: Already integrated via model relationships
- **Inventory Management**: Potential integration for supplier-specific stock tracking
- **Financial Module**: Potential integration for supplier payment tracking
