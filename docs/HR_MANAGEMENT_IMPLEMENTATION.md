Route::middleware(['permission:departments.view'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('departments', [DepartmentController::class, 'index'])->name('departments.index');
});

// Employees
Route::middleware(['permission:employees.view'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('employees', [EmployeeController::class, 'index'])->name('employees.index');
});

// Attendances
Route::middleware(['permission:attendances.view'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('attendances', [AttendanceController::class, 'index'])->name('attendances.index');
});

// Time Offs
Route::middleware(['permission:time-offs.view'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('time-offs', [TimeOffController::class, 'index'])->name('time-offs.index');
});

// Payrolls
Route::middleware(['permission:payrolls.view'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('payrolls', [PayrollController::class, 'index'])->name('payrolls.index');
});
```
