# Product Management Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the Product Management module for the Yousaha ERP system, following the sequence diagrams and requirements specified in `docs/sequence/master-data.md`.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Product CRUD Operations
- **Create**: Add new products with comprehensive information
- **Read**: View product list with pagination and filtering
- **Update**: Edit existing product details
- **Delete**: Remove products (with safety checks)

### 2. Product Information Management
- **Basic Details**: Name, SKU, Type (Goods/Service/Combo)
- **Pricing**: Selling price, taxes, cost price
- **Inventory Settings**: Track inventory, product shrink flags
- **Additional Info**: Barcode, reference, timestamps

### 3. Security & Permissions
- **Permission-based Access**: View, Create, Edit, Delete permissions
- **Company Isolation**: Products are isolated per company
- **Role-based Access**: Different user roles have different access levels

### 4. User Interface
- **Responsive Design**: Bootstrap-based responsive layout
- **Modern UI**: Clean, professional interface with icons
- **Form Validation**: Client and server-side validation
- **User Feedback**: Success/error messages and confirmations

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Controller (`app/Http/Controllers/ProductController.php`)
```php
class ProductController extends Controller
{
    public function index()      // List products
    public function create()     // Show create form
    public function store()      // Save new product
    public function edit()       // Show edit form
    public function update()     // Update existing product
    public function destroy()    // Delete product
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Company isolation using `Auth::user()->currentCompany`
- Comprehensive validation with custom error messages
- Safety checks before deletion (prevents deletion of products in use)
- Proper error handling and user feedback

### 2. Model (`app/Models/Product.php`)
```php
class Product extends Model
{
    // Relationships
    public function company()
    public function productShrink()
    public function salesOrderLines()
    public function purchaseOrderLines()
    public function receiptLines()
    public function deliveryLines()
    public function stocks()
    
    // Accessors
    public function getTotalPriceAttribute()
    public function getProfitMarginAttribute()
    
    // Helper methods
    public function isGoods()
    public function isService()
    public function isCombo()
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Comprehensive relationships with other ERP modules
- Calculated attributes for total price and profit margin
- Type checking methods for product categories

### 3. Views
- **Index** (`resources/views/pages/product/index.blade.php`): Product list with actions
- **Create** (`resources/views/pages/product/create.blade.php`): Add new product form
- **Edit** (`resources/views/pages/product/edit.blade.php`): Edit existing product form

**Key Features:**
- Responsive Bootstrap layout
- Form validation with error display
- Interactive elements (delete confirmation, auto-SKU generation)
- Company information display
- Permission-based action buttons

### 4. Routes (`routes/web.php`)
```php
// Product Management Routes
Route::middleware(['permission:products.view'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('products', [ProductController::class, 'index'])->name('products.index');
});

Route::middleware(['permission:products.create'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('products/create', [ProductController::class, 'create'])->name('products.create');
    Route::post('products', [ProductController::class, 'store'])->name('products.store');
});

Route::middleware(['permission:products.edit'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('products/{product}/edit', [ProductController::class, 'edit'])->name('products.edit');
    Route::put('products/{product}', [ProductController::class, 'update'])->name('products.update');
});

Route::middleware(['permission:products.delete'])->group(function () {
    Route::delete('products/{product}', [ProductController::class, 'destroy'])->name('products.delete');
});
```

### 5. Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    id BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    company_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    sku VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    type ENUM('goods', 'service', 'combo') NOT NULL,
    is_track_inventory BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(18,2) NOT NULL,
    taxes DECIMAL(18,2) NULLABLE,
    cost DECIMAL(18,2) NULLABLE,
    barcode VARCHAR(100) NULLABLE,
    reference VARCHAR(255) NULLABLE,
    is_shrink BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    
    FOREIGN KEY (company_id) REFERENCES companies(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    UNIQUE KEY unique_sku_per_company (sku, company_id)
);
```

## User Workflow

### 1. View Product List
1. User signs in to the system
2. Navigates to Products from sidebar or home page
3. System displays paginated list of company products
4. User can see product details, type, pricing, and inventory status

### 2. Create New Product
1. User clicks "Add New Product" button
2. System shows product creation form
3. User fills in required fields (name, SKU, type, price)
4. Optional fields: taxes, cost, barcode, reference
5. User sets inventory tracking and shrink options
6. System validates data and creates product
7. User is redirected to product list with success message

### 3. Edit Existing Product
1. User clicks edit button on product row
2. System shows edit form with pre-filled values
3. User modifies desired fields
4. System validates changes and updates product
5. User is redirected to product list with success message

### 4. Delete Product
1. User clicks delete button on product row
2. System shows confirmation dialog
3. User confirms deletion
4. System checks if product can be safely deleted
5. If safe, product is removed; if not, error message is shown

## Security Features

### 1. Permission System
- **products.view**: Can view product list
- **products.create**: Can create new products
- **products.edit**: Can edit existing products
- **products.delete**: Can delete products

### 2. Company Isolation
- All products are scoped to the user's current company
- Users cannot access products from other companies
- SKU uniqueness is enforced per company

### 3. Data Validation
- Server-side validation for all input fields
- SQL injection prevention through Eloquent ORM
- XSS protection through Blade templating
- CSRF protection on all forms

### 4. Safe Deletion
- Products cannot be deleted if they have:
  - Sales order lines
  - Purchase order lines
  - Receipt lines
  - Delivery lines
  - Stock records

## Testing

### Test Coverage
The implementation includes comprehensive test coverage:

```bash
php artisan test tests/Feature/ProductManagementTest.php
```

**Test Cases:**
- Permission-based access control
- CRUD operations validation
- Company isolation verification
- Data integrity checks
- Error handling validation

### Test Factories
- **UserFactory**: Generates test users with proper attributes
- **CompanyFactory**: Creates test companies
